        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>BigBrandCity</strong> represents creativity, innovation, and excellence in the world of design. The
          name reflects a digital hub for individuals and businesses looking to enhance their brand identity through
          graphics, web design, and corporate branding services. I chose this name because it captures the vision of
          creating “big brands” that stand out in a competitive city-like marketplace.</p>
